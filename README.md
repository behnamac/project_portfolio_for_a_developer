# Developer Portfolio Website  

## Description  
This project is a developer portfolio website inspired by a design template from Dribbble. I built it using **solid HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, ensuring a fully responsive and clean-coded implementation.  

To maintain a well-structured and maintainable project, I used the **BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology** for CSS, ensuring modularity, readability, and scalability. The goal was to create a professional and elegant portfolio website while keeping the code **logical, modular, and easy to maintain**.

- **BEM CSS Structure**: Organized and maintainable styling approach.  
- **Modular & Clean Code**: Designed for easy scalability and updates.
